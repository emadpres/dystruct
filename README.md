DyStruct
========

DyStruct, or dynamic structs, is a C++ library for efficient, runtime-composed data structures. It hopefully will provide access, reflection, s11n, etc.


Building
--------

To build, you need to have the /premake4/ build system generator. Use the premake4.lua in the scripts directory to generate your favorite build system (e.g. makefile, VS project file, etc.) Currently, nothing but Windows/VC is tested though.
